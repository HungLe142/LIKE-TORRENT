TO DO:
    - Check network config with virtualBox -> OK
    - Make scenarious: set up peers, each of them has different parts of file.
    - Seeding activites:
        + After an interval of time (may be a minute), each peer need to contact tracker for keep aliving as seeder?
        + Send Bitfield message for each peer when start connection
    - Choosing pieces algorithm: downloading in turn, each tá»§n base on peer-list receiving from the tracker
        + Synchronizing technique (mutex lock, simaphore,...) for protecting the downloaded list, bitfield list when downloading from multi peers.
        + After get all pieces in the connection with a peer, disconnect with it?
        + Each 1 minutes, contact trackers for new peer list.
        + Contact peers in the list for receiving algorithm
            * After receiving the bitfield message, compare and try to get pieces we don't have?
        + 
    - Print report:
        + print line: Get which piece of file from which peer
        +
